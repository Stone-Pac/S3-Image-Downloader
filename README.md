# S3-Image-Downloade

The code is a Python script that can download images from an Amazon S3 bucket. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

First, the script asks the user to enter the name of an S3 bucket and a prefix for the images they want to download.
The script then sends a request to the S3 bucket using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python (also known as Boto3) to get a list of all the objects (files) in the bucket that match the prefix.
The script then parses the response from S3, which is in XML format, to extract the filenames and sizes of the images that match the prefix.
The script sorts the list of images by size, so that it downloads the largest images first.
For each image, the script downloads the image data and saves it to a zip file.
Finally, the script prints out the name and size of the zip file, as well as its location on the computer.
So, in short, the script allows you to download a bunch of images from an S3 bucket, and it saves them all to a single zip file for easy storage and transfer.
